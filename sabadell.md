Banco Sabadell has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank

Strategic planIn February 2014, Banco Sabadell started its 2014–2016 business plan, Triple, that aims to leverage its new size and margin-generating capability. The main goal of the 2014–2016 Triple Plan is profitability. Key themes of the new plan are transformation (transformation of the business, transformation of the production process and transformation of the balance sheet) and internationalization (laying the foundations for becoming more international in terms of structure and resources and entering new markets). 

History

On 31 December 1881, a group of 127 businessmen and traders from Sabadell, in the province of Barcelona, founded the Bank with the purpose of financing local industries and providing them with raw materials (wool and coal) under more favourable conditions.

In 1907, Banco Sabadell began a new stage: it ended its non-banking businesses to focus on commercial banking. In 1953, in order to preserve the organisation's independence, the shareholders created a share syndication agreement.

In 1965, Banco Sabadell slowly spread to nearby towns. In 1975, it expanded beyond Catalonia, opening a branch in Madrid. In 1978, Banco Sabadell expanded internationally, initially in the City of London.

The bank is a pioneer in bank computing in Spain. In 1968, it automated accounting and administrative processes. In 1986, it introduced remote banking: the telephone (FonoBanc) and computer (InfoBanc) were incorporated as new channels for communication and service prodivision. In 1998, it launched BancSabadell Net, Spain's first Internet banking service.

In 1988, Sabadell MultiBanca, later Sabadell Banca Privada, opened, specialising in equity management and private banking and the Banco Sabadell group was formed.

In 1996, Banco Sabadell started a new expansion phase, increasing its size and operating capacity.

Banco Sabadell went public in 2001 and became a member of the IBEX 35 in 2004.

Since 2007, the Bank has doubled in size and is currently Spain's fifth largest bank. Acquisitions include NatWest Spain, Banco Herrero, Banco Atlántico, Banco Urquijo, TransAtlantic Bank, Private Banking Business of BBVA (US), Mellon United National Bank, Banco Guipuzcoano, Lydian Private Bank, Banco CAM, Banco Mare Nostrum (BMN) network in Catalonia and Aragon, Lloyds TSB Spain, Banco Gallego, Lloyds TSB Miami and JGB Bank.

On 5 October 2017, the board of Banco Sabadell decided in an emergency session to move their legal base to Alicante in response to growing political insecurity in Catalonia.[5] A few days later, the bank decided to move its fiscal domicile to Alicante too.[6]

In December 2018, it was announced the selling of 80% of Solvia to Intrum.[7]

In May 2024, BBVA presented a $13.11 billion takeover bid directly to Sabadell's shareholders. However, the Economy Ministry has the power to block any merger or acquisition of a bank, meaning that the Spanish government has six months to decide whether to block this takeover. A takeover bid is a formal process by which an investor makes an offer directly to the shareholders of a listed company to acquire their shares.

On May 9th 2024, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA) announced the submission of a takeover bid for Banco Sabadell, offering Banco Sabadell shareholders BBVA shares based on the following exchange ratio: 1 BBVA share for every 4.83 Banco Sabadell shares.

The takeover bid launched by BBVA is considered hostile because it was submitted without prior agreement with Banco Sabadell’s board of directors.
Prior to the announcement of the takeover bid, the Board of Directors of Banco Sabadell had rejected an unsolicited, tentative, and conditional merger proposal received from BBVA on April 30th 2024 (under the same economic conditions later set out in the takeover bid).

The Board of Directors of Banco Sabadell rejected the proposal, as it significantly undervalued Banco Sabadell’s business and its future growth prospects as an independent institution. The Board of Directors expressed its full confidence in Banco Sabadell’s growth strategy and financial goals, believing that Banco Sabadell’s strategy as an independent institution would generate greater value for its shareholders. It also indicated that the significant fall and volatility of BBVA’s share price in the days prior to the rejection of the proposal led to additional uncertainty about the value of the proposal.

Based on a detailed analysis of the proposal, the Board of Directors concluded that the offer was not in the interest of Banco Sabadell or its shareholders, and consequently rejected BBVA’s proposal.

The Board of Directors added that it believed its decision was in line with the interests of Banco Sabadell’s clients and employees.

In relation to Banco Sabadell’s business, it is worth noting that the bank went from earning €2 million in 2020 to €1.332 billion in 2023. In other words, Banco Sabadell went from a Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE) of 0% in 2020 to 11.5% in 2023. Following this striking improvement in profitability, Banco Sabadell’s share price rose from €0.35 per share on 31 December 2020 to €1.91 per share on 24 May 2024, the date on which BBVA filed the application for authorisation of the takeover bid before the CNMV, positioning itself as the Ibex 35 stock that has undergone the greatest revaluation during the that period.
In 2024, Banco Sabadell’s results have continued to improve:

    The Bank has delivered a profit of €791 million in profit, the best half-year figure in its history.
    This level of profits has allowed the Group to increase its ROTE to 13.1% as at the end of June, representing an improvement of 395 basis points year-on-year compared to 12.2% in the previous quarter and 11.5% at the end of 2023.
    The CET1 FL capital ratio has risen to 13.48%, entailing an increase of 18 basis points in the quarter and of 27 basis points compared to the end of 2023.
    Commercial activity in Spain consolidated the good performance of the first quarter, with strong growth in lending to SMEs and corporates, mortgages, and in consumer loans, alongside an improvement of margins and asset quality.
    TSB increased its mortgage completions by 42% year-on-year and contributed 95 million euros to Group profit.
    Following its profound transformation, the Bank has reiterated its improved prospects by delivering record results and highlighting its increased capacity to generate capital and long-term value for its shareholders.

# Banc Sabadell, more than 140 years of history
Founded on the last day of 1881 as a cooperative and opening its doors to the public in February 1882, Banco Sabadell has a track record of 140 years spent advising and financially serving people and companies.
 
Reaching this milestone offers us an opportunity to look back at the journey we have made. The history of Banco Sabadell is the story of the launch of a small local bank at the end of the 19th century, which, over time, has grown into a multinational banking group with a set of corporate values that have defined its very way of being and carrying out its banking work.

Its trajectory has been exemplary and trailblazing in many respects. The bank has covered a long and fruitful path in which it has tackled important business, social, and economic challenges, which it has been able to overcome thanks to the vision, determination, pragmatism, and professionalism of its leaders over the years, as well as the work, effort, dedication, and commitment of all the people who have worked with it from day one, with the conviction and enthusiasm to build up a project that they have been able to make their own.

In 1881, a group of businessmen from the city of Sabadell founded Banco de Sabadell with a capital of 10 million pesetas. The early years were characterised by the bank’s active role in the wool and coal mining trade, which it abandoned in the early 20th century to focus exclusively on financial services. The 1920s and 1930s were characterised by the economic crisis, political instability, and social conflicts, difficulties that the bank overcame thanks to the good governance that emerged from the crisis of confidence that the bank had experienced in 1926.

In the 1940s, the bank focused its activity on stabilising its situation and restoring normality after the Spanish Civil War. Years later, it was already enjoying a high degree of confidence. The country’s economic recovery had allowed it to grow in terms of operations and share capital until, in 1965, it opened its first office situated outside Sabadell, in Sant Cugat del Vallès. From then on, the bank’s branches spread to nearby towns and even into Barcelona. Shortly after that, it opened its first branch in Madrid, and at the end of the 1970s its first foreign branch, in London.

The last two decades of the 20th century were characterised by two levers of transformation. On the one hand there was technology, with a strong commitment by the bank to consolidate the computerisation of its processes and implement the teleprocessing of data. On the other was its configuration as a business group through the creation of subsidiaries that could respond to the specialisation needs of an increasingly extensive and internationalised commercial network. In the 1990s, the corporate image was revamped and “Banco Sabadell” was born, without the preposition “de”, as a commercial brand.

In 1996, the bank’s first non-organic deal was formalised with the purchase of the NatWest España group. The new millennium began with the purchase of Banco Herrero and its flotation, which took place on 18 April 2001. In 2003, the purchase of Banco Atlántico was signed, which meant an increase in size that made Banco Sabadell one of the leading institutions in the Spanish market. In 2004, the bank’s shares were included in the IBEX 35 index. In 2006, Banco Urquijo was acquired, and in 2007, so was TransAtlantic Bank of Miami in the United States.

Banco Sabadell positioned itself as a one of the buying entities in the process of bank concentration caused by the great financial crisis, which erupted in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In Spain, it acquired Banco Guipuzcoano (2010), Banco CAM (2011), the branch network in Catalonia and Aragon of the former Caixa Penedès (2012), Banco Gallego, and the Spanish business of Lloyds (2013). In addition to this, the bank began an ambitious process of internationalisation, which materialised with the acquisition of the British bank TSB in 2015 and the creation of a bank in Mexico in 2016. The bank became one of the largest institutions in the Spanish financial system during these years, tripling its size, geographically diversifying its business, and increasing its customer base sixfold, all while safeguarding its solvency and liquidity. On 31 December 2021, Banco Sabadell celebrated its 140th anniversary, looking to the future with the same drive, enthusiasm, and ambition that it had possessed on 31 December 1881.

# Banco Sabadell Historical Archives
The Banco Sabadell Historical Archives (BSHA) were set up in 2005 to preserve, manage and share the documentary heritage of the Bank. The collection of documents in the BSHA, which are owned by Banco Sabadell, contains the documentation of Banco Sabadell and of all of the entities that have been incorporated into the Group since it was first founded in 1881. The Banco Sabadell Foundation is responsible for the technical management of the Archives.

Documentary collection
The archive has a collection specialising in banking documentation as well as, to a lesser extent, corporate and patrimonial documentation. The collection is of special interest to all those who wish to know and study the Catalan and Spanish economic history of the late 19th and 20th centuries.

A constantly growing database
Between archive and library documentation, the BSHA has a database of 57,000 records that is constantly growing. Apart from the archive of the Banco de España, Banco Sabadell's archive is one of the few historical banking archives open to the public and with services for researchers in the country.
 
BSHA Publications
The Banco Sabadell Historical Archive has participated in the publication of the "Guide to historical archives of banking in Spain”, an edition resulting from the meetings of the Working Group of the Project for the Recovery of Historical Archives of Banking in Spain, promoted by the Banco de España, Archives and Document Management Division.
